# Cross-Lingual-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
Build a cross-lingual sentiment analysis model using python.
Using the Mono-Lingual Embedding, then using the Multi-Lingual Embedding and improve the results.
Build a SVM, RBF, Neural Network, BilSTM+3CNN Models and compare them.
Use the mono lingual and multi lingual embedding in each model and compare the results.
Compare the moving from English to Arabic with moving from English to French in the problem of cross-linguality.
Finally, build a web app that use our final model and take a sentece or file of sentences in English or Arabic, and make sentiment analysis for it to predict if it is Positive or Negative.
